# To-Do List Web Application

## Overview
This is a simple To-Do List web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them. The design is clean, modern, and responsive, making it usable on both desktop and mobile devices. This project was created as part of my portfolio to showcase my skills in web development.
