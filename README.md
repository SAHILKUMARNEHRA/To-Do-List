# 📋 To-Do List Web Application

## 🚀 Project Overview

Welcome to my To-Do List Web Application**! This is a simple yet functional task manager built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them with ease. The design is clean, modern, and fully responsive, making it a great addition to my portfolio as I apply for internships.
